Testimonials
 “I have removed a lot of stigma around mental health by the fact that I have information on it. I know that me having mental health issues, does not make me any less of a person, does not make me any less deserving. I feel like everyone who gets knowledge of mental health, knows how to embrace themselves and I think that is a powerful thing to do.” - Rafiki

‘’I found a safe space and community in Nakujali and this has helped me improve my resilience. Today, I am not ashamed to share my story; I use it to raise awareness and help destigmatize suicide and mental health. I support 20 youths in my group and look forward to increasing my reach to thousands of others in my community.’’ - Griffin, Rafiki

‘’As I continue on my life journey, I feel more empowered and better equipped to navigate life's challenges. I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Mental 360 for bringing such a transformative support system closer to us. This initiative has been life-changing, and I hope it reaches even more people in need.’’ -  Lawrence, Rafiki

‘’When I first heard about therapy, I assumed it was only for people with psychological issues. I never imagined it was something I needed, believing I had everything under control—or so I thought. Wow, was I wrong! I didn't realize how much I needed therapy until I reached out to Mental 360 and had my first session. Over the months, I've discovered so much about myself, my thought processes, and habits I wasn't even aware of. It's been an incredible journey, opening doors to self-reflection and growth. I truly believe I'm becoming a better man because of this decision. Now, I'm a strong advocate for therapy and grateful I took that first step. Thank you, Mental 360, for being with me on this journey!’’ - Austin, Therapy Client

‘’I am really glad I got to meet mental 360. Most of the positive energy I possess right now is all thanks to you guys. you really are concerned with people's wellbeing and honestly it was a great moment to grow and learn. I was going through stuff that kept pulling me back and these thoughts kept winning until I met mental 360 who showed me that I am more than meets the eye. I am worth a lot. I can achieve a lot. At least now I am able to sit by myself and generate some positivity and build on it. I am more confident and I guess I can face my fears more confidently. thank you so much mental 360. keep up the good work.’’ - Anonymous, Therapy Client
